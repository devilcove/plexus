Disable TLS
===========
If the server is to be installed behind a reverse proxy or in a lan only setting, tls can be disabled.  Both web and nats traffic will be unencrypted.
### Configuration
* [see configuration settings](configuration.md)
* set secure = false
* set port (default 8080) to desired listening port for web traffic
* fqdn must be set (can be an IP address) such that all peers can resolve the address of the server
> setting fqdn to an IP address in not valid with secure=true.  Let's Encrypt does not support certificates for [IP addresses](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/ssl-on-a-ip-instead-of-domain/90635)
